You can download the images from the “Testing images” folder for testing.
In my example images(in "Testing images" folder), the reference image is abbreviated as “ref”, and the measured image as “mea”.

* Reference image: captured without the DOE waveguide (projector → camera)

* Measured image: captured with the DOE waveguide (projector → DOE waveguide → camera)

You may run the Python script directly or download the standalone .exe app (“Image analysis.exe”), which requires no installation.

The app automatically creates a timestamp-named folder at:
D:\Image analysis\

*If you would like to try your images, please make sure that the input images are single-channel (grayscale) images,
i.e., the images captured using a monochromatic CCD.
